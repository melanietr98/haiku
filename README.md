## Haiku Lab Using React

This example renders a famous haiku by Katsuhika Hokusai, with each line wrapped in a <p> tag. My job is to insert an "hr" tag
seperator between each paragraph.The resulting structure should look like this:

<article>
<p> I write, erase, rewrite </p>
<hr />
<p> Erase again, and then </p>
<hr />
<p> a poppy blooms. </p>
</article>

<p> A haiku only contains three lines, but your solution should work with any number of lines. Note that the hr elements only appeaar between the p tag elements not the beginning or end
